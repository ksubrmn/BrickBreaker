# BrickBreaker

Game Controls

A - Starts game from title screen
SELECT - Go back to title screen
START - Launches ball from paddle
Left/Right arrows - move the paddle from left to right

Objective
The goal of the game is to use your ball and paddle to break the bricks at the top of the screen. If you break all the bricks without running out of lives, you win the game. If you run out of lives before all the bricks are gone, you lose.

Brick Types
Red - your paddle size decreases
Green - your paddle size increases
Blue - you gain a life

Game Play
Whenever you launch the ball from the paddle, or whenever the ball bounces off the paddle, the ball will get the horizontal velocity of the paddle. For example, if the paddle moves left when the ball bounces off of it, the ball will start to move left. 

Use your lives carefully. It might be good strategy to allow yourself to lose a life in order to position the ball from scratch.

Note: There is no score. You either win or lose (much like real life).
